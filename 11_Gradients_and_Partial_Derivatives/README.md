<h1 align="center">Gradients and Partial Derivatives</h1>

In this session, we explore gradients and partial derivatives and their importance for multivariable functions and optimisation problems. We define partial derivatives and the gradient vector, which are essential for understanding functions of several variables and their use in machine learning and optimisation.

We also introduce local extrema, saddle points, and the second-derivative test, and connect these ideas to gradient descent. The exercises include finding stationary points, computing partial derivatives and gradients, and interpreting what the gradient tells us about the direction of steepest increase. These concepts play a central role in machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and numerical optimisation.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1 (recap): Derivatives

Find the derivatives of the following functions:

1. \(\frac{1}{\left(1+e^{2 x}\right)^3}\)
2. \((2 x+5)^7\left(3 x^4-8\right)^5\)

??? answer "&nbsp;"

    1. \(-\frac{6 e^{2 x}}{\left(1+e^{2 x}\right)^4}\)

    2. \(14(2 x+5)^6\left(3 x^4-8\right)^5+60 x^3(2 x+5)^7\left(3 x^4-8\right)^4\)

#### Exercise 2: Second Order Derivative Test

For the following, find all stationary points, find the second order derivative at these points, and classify them as a maximum or minimum using the second order derivative test.

1. \(f(x)=6 x-x^2\)
2. \(f(x)=-(x-5)^2\)

??? answer "&nbsp;"

    1. Maximum at \(x=3\) since \(f^{\prime \prime}(3) < 0\)
    2. Maximum at \(x=5\) since \(f^{\prime \prime}(5) < 0\)

#### Exercise 3: Stationary Points

Find all stationary points (maxima, minima, or inflection points), and intervals of concavity for the following function:

$$
f(x)=x^3-12 x
$$

??? answer "&nbsp;"

    \(\begin{aligned} & 3 x^2-12=0 \Rightarrow x= \pm 2 \\ & f^{\prime \prime}(-2)=-12 \Rightarrow \text { local max local max of } 16 \text { at } x=-2 \\ & f^{\prime \prime}(2)=12 \Rightarrow \text { local min local min of }-16 \text { at } x=2\end{aligned}\)

    

#### Exercise 4: Functions of Two Variables

Find the domain and range of the function \(f(x, y)=\sqrt{36-9 x^2-9 y^2}\) and sketch the domain.


??? answer "&nbsp;"

    Domain: \(\left\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x^2+y^2 \leq 4\right\}\)

    Range: \([0, 6]\)

#### Exercise 5: Partial Derivatives
Calculate \(\partial f / \partial x\) and \(\partial f / \partial y\) for the following functions:

1. \(f(x, y)=x^2-3 x y+2 y^2-4 x+5 y-12\)
2. \(f(x, y)=x^2 y^3-2 x^3 y^2+3 x y-4\)

??? answer "&nbsp;"

    1. \(\partial f / \partial x = 2x-3y-4\) and \(\partial f / \partial y = -3x+4y+5\)
    2. \(\partial f / \partial x = 2xy^3-6x^2y^2+3y\) and \(\partial f / \partial y = 3x^2y^2-4x^3y+3x\)

#### Exercise 6: Gradients

Let

$$
f(x, y)=x^2+4 y^2-3 x y .
$$

1. Compute the gradient \(\nabla f(x, y)\).
2. Evaluate the gradient at the point ( 1,2 ).
3. Explain what the gradient vector at that point tells you about the behaviour of the function.

??? answer "&nbsp;"
    1. \(\nabla f(x, y)=\langle 2x-3y,\ 8y-3x\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 2x-3y \\ 8y-3x \end{bmatrix}\)
    2. \(\nabla f(1,2)=\begin{bmatrix} 2(1)-3(2) \\ 8(2)-3(1) \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 13 \end{bmatrix}\)
    3. The gradient vector points in the direction in which the function \(f(x, y)\) increases most rapidly. From the point (1, 2) in the \(x y\)-plane, moving in the direction of the vector \((-4,13)\) will result in the steepest increase in the value of the function.
