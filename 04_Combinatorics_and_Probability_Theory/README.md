<h1 align="center">Combinatorics and Probability Theory</h1>

This session explores the principles of counting and the foundations of probability theory.  
We work with the multiplication rule, permutations and combinations, and classical probability of events.  
We also introduce conditional probability and non-trivial applications that illustrate the depth of these concepts.

    \[
    (A \oplus B) \cap A
    = [(A \cap B^c) \cup (A^c \cap B)] \cap A

    $\binom{52}{47}=2,598,960$

??? answer "&nbsp;"

    $1-\left(\frac{4095}{4096}\right)^3 \approx 0.00073$

#### Exercise 6: Webpage Passwords

A webpage requires the user to create a password that contains exactly 4 characters.

Let $A$ denote the set of passwords containing only letters (there are 26 lowercase letters, a-z, and 26 uppercase letters, A-Z).

Let $B$ denote the set of passwords containing only numbers (0-9).

Let $C$ denote the set of passwords that can contain both letters and numbers. A hacker tries to guess the password of a particular user.

What is the probability that he guesses the correct password in the first attempt in each of the cases below?

1. If only $A$ is allowed:

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"
    
        $\frac{1}{52^4}= \frac{1}{7,311,616}$

2. If only $B$ is allowed:

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"
    
        $\frac{1}{10^4}= \frac{1}{10,000}$

3. If only $A \cup B$ is allowed:

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"
    
        $\frac{1}{52^4+10^4}= \frac{1}{7,321,616}$

4. If $C$ is allowed:

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"
    
        $\frac{1}{62^4}= \frac{1}{14,776,336}$

#### Exercise 7: Probability

2.  Determine each of the following probabilities:

    $P(A)$

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        $P(A)=\frac{2}{5}$

    $P(B)$

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        $P(B)=\frac{3}{5}$

    $P(\overline{A})$

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        $P(\overline{A})=\frac{3}{5}$


    $P(A \cup B)$

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        $P(A \cup B)=1$


    $P(A \cap B)$

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        $P(A \cap B)=0$

### Challenge Exercises

#### Challenge Exercise 1: Passwords

A computer password consists of 4 characters, each one of 26 lowercase letters or 26 uppercase letters or an integer between 0 and 9. If the password must contain at least one letter and at least one integer, how many different passwords are possible?

??? answer "&nbsp;"

    The easiest way to calculate this, is to first calculate the number of 4-character passwords, and then subtract those that do not fulfill the rule, i.e. the passwords that do either only contain letters or only numbers: $62^4-52^4-10^4=7,454,720$

#### Challenge Exercise 2: Coupon Collector Problem

You repeatedly draw a card uniformly at random from a standard 52-card deck, with replacement.

What is the expected number of draws until you have seen all 52 distinct cards at least once?

??? answer "&nbsp;"

    The expected value is $52 \cdot H_{52}$, where $H_{n}$ is the $n$-th harmonic number.
    $H_{52} \approx \ln(52)+\gamma+ \tfrac{1}{2\cdot 52} \approx 4.518$.
    Result: $\approx 52 \cdot 4.518 = 235$ draws.

#### Challenge Exercise 3: Generalized Birthday Problem

How many people are needed in a room so that the probability of **at least three** sharing the same birthday exceeds $0.5$ (assume 365 equally likely birthdays, ignore leap years)?

??? answer "&nbsp;"

    Using Poisson approximation: expected number of triples $\approx \frac{n^3}{6\cdot 365^2}$.
    Solve $\frac{n^3}{6\cdot 365^2} \approx \ln 2 \approx 0.693$.
    $n \approx (0.693 \cdot 6 \cdot 365^2)^{1/3} \approx 88$.
    So around **88 people** are required.

#### Challenge Exercise 4: Conditional Probability with Urns

An urn contains 5 red balls and 7 blue balls. You draw two balls without replacement.

1.  What is the probability the two balls are of the same color?

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        $P(\text{same})=\frac{\binom{5}{2}+\binom{7}{2}}{\binom{12}{2}}=\frac{10+21}{66}=\frac{31}{66}\approx 0.47$

2.  Suppose you draw one ball (not revealing its color), then return it, then draw again. What is the probability both are the same color?

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        With replacement: $P(\text{same})=\left(\tfrac{5}{12}\right)^2+\left(\tfrac{7}{12}\right)^2=\tfrac{25+49}{144}=\tfrac{74}{144}=\tfrac{37}{72}\approx 0.51$

3.  Explain the difference between the two scenarios.

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        Without replacement introduces dependence (fewer balls left), lowering the chance of a match. With replacement, draws are independent, giving a slightly higher probability.
